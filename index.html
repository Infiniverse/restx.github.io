        <h3>Welcome to RESTX.IO</h3>

<p>This is the home page of the RESTX project, the lightweight Java REST framework:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>focused on REST, not a general web framework</strong>
it means no templating mechanism, use it with your favorite JS framework!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>no reflection</strong>
we prefer annotation processing, so that even with some magic you can always view the source.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>good performance</strong>
everything is compiled, we always keep performance into account during the design, especially startup time.
Still the framework is not async oriented, this is a design choice: most data access API are synchronous anyway (JDBC, Mongo java driver, ...) and it's easier to program, especially for Java developers.
Async support is planned:</p>

<ul>
<li>through web socket with fallback support (probably with Atmosphere)</li>
<li>through JavaRX support (not a priority)
If what you want is a truly async oriented framework, have a look at vert.x or Play2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>amazing integration with MongoDB...</strong>
relying on Jackson and Jongo gives true symmetry between client and datastore payloads, plus some very cool features like data recording for easy integration testing </p></li>
<li><p><strong>... but not only</strong>
restx is not specific to MongoDB, you can use it with any datastore with a Java API</p></li>
<li><p><strong>easy testing</strong>
a human readable declarative end 2 end tests support with a recording feature easing non regression tests</p></li>
<li><p><strong>REST API documentation</strong>
leveraging a customized version of swagger, as soon as you declare a end point it is documented</p></li>
<li><p><strong>... with innovation inside</strong>
the declarative tests are also used as a source of documentation, giving always working examples!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>admin web console</strong>
monitoring, DI container exploration, API documentation, recording console, ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>enterprise friendly</strong>
pure Java, can be deployed as a simple servlet, you can even use it alongside another framework, good maven support, relationnal DB support (soon)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>... but not only</strong>
strong support for embedded launch, starts up in less than 0.5s (depends mostly on DB connection and class loading, by itself a restx server can start in less than 100ms)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>type safe DI</strong>
features a small dependency injection engine, based on annotation processing and code generation</p></li>
<li><p><strong>strong integration with google guava and joda time</strong>
because we can't live without them</p></li>
<li><p><strong>cloud friendly (soon)</strong>
ready to deploy on many cloud offerings (Cloudbees, heroku, ...)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>easy to setup</strong>
a command line helps to create new apps, run and deploy them on the cloud</p></li>
