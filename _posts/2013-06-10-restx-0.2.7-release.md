Today we are very happy to announce the third public release of RESTX, version 0.2.7.

Continuing on the 2 weeks release cycle, this release comes with a few improvements and bug fixes:

- improvements to the api-docs console, with better keyboard navigation
- a new junit runner, which let you use all [specs](/docs/ref-specs.html) in a specific folder as individual tests
- a new "send & record" button in api-docs, allowing to easily record requests and save them as specs, instantly detected as new examples and new tests if you use the new test runner
- better dev mode support, with automatic detection of classpath resources in your sources directories, giving better development workflow especially when developing admin console plugins
- new [alternatives support](/docs/ref-factory.html) in dependency injection engine
- several bug fixes

And remember that if you have already installed restx you can simply use the `shell upgrade` command to get the updated version. Enjoy!
