## Getting started / Upgrading

Want to get started now? Check out the [related doc](/docs/getting-started.html).


Upgrading from an earlier version?

- in your projects you just need to update `restx.version` to 0.33.1 in your dependency descriptor
- in your code you might have to adapt to some breaking changes (see below)
- in the shell, run `shell upgrade` to upgrade your shell and plugins. Note: a breaking change in this version may make the shell to fail after the upgrade. In such case delete the jars in your .restx/plugins directory, or reinstall from scratch.


You can check commits introducing breaking changes:
