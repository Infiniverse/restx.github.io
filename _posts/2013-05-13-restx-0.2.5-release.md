Today we are very happy to announce the first public release of RESTX, version 0.2.5.

The project is still in its early infancy, but now you should be able to [discover what it does](/), understand [its main concepts](/docs/features.html) and [try it out](/docs/getting-started.html) very easily.

We hope you will like what you see, feel free to leave a comment below or join the [community](/community/).
