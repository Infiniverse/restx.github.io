Today we are very happy to announce the second public release of RESTX, version 0.2.6.

2 weeks after the first release, this release comes with a few improvements and bug fixes:

- [4 samples](/docs/samples.html) demonstrating several features of restx, such as the integration with MongoDB or using custom routes
- improved JUnit rule for starting and stopping server, which now allow to use another server than Jetty, and to use the rule for tests other than specs
- upgrade [jongo](http://jongo.org) from 0.3 to 0.4 in restx-jongo module
- several bug fixes

Want to get started now? Check out the [related doc](/docs/getting-started.html).

And remember that if you have already installed restx you can simply use the `shell upgrade` command to get the updated version. Enjoy!
