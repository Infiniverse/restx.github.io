Today we are very happy to announce yet another release of RESTX, version 0.30.

## New and Noteworthy

### core improvements

- new [settings](/docs/ref-settings.html) support, allowing to easily define type safe settings, based on annotation processing
- many API reviews, which shouldn't impact those who only use the annotation endpoints, but which make good steps toward API stabilization
- new customizable entity mapping support, allowing to use something else than json/Jackson marshalling/unmarshalling for your requests/responses body
- support for text/plain responses (when you use String in your return type)
- support for void return type in your resource endpoint methods (which defaults to a 204 No Content status response)
- support for enum in query params

### shell improvements

- auto upgrade plugins when upgrading shell
- allow to compile and run app in non interactive mode, which for instance eases the creation of docker.io images
- use `JAVA_OPTS` and `RESTX_OPTS` as vm options when launching the shell, allowing to set proxy config for example

### api-docs improvements

- new "related operations" feature, easing navigation between operations, and reuse of responses in other requests (see [screenshot](https://twitter.com/xavierhanin/status/400379895362375680) to get an idea)

### factory improvements

- multi injection in Factory allow to inject `Iterable<MyComponent>` in your components, see [doc](/docs/ref-factory.html) for details

### others

- upgraded third party libraries versions
- several bug fixes and minor improvements

## Getting started / Upgrading

Upgrading from an earlier version?

- you just need to run `restx shell upgrade` to upgrade your shell and plugins.
- in your projects you just need to update `restx.version` to 0.30 in your dependency descriptor
- in your code you may have to adapt to some breaking changes, the most probable being that `SignatureKey` has moved to restx.security
