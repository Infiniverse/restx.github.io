Today we are very happy to announce release 0.32 of RESTX, the lightweight, modular, feature rich, blazing fast and open source Java REST framework.

## New and Noteworthy

### core improvements

- introduced `AutoPreparable` components, adding finer grain lifecycle for components
- introduce RestxResponse.getCharset() in API
- Review cookie signing implementation with a [new concept of "signer"](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/547f50e7c7b123d2ed3c640497efe22d5eaffbb7), giving more flexibility

### shell

- easy app archiving with the new `app archive` command, compatible with `app grab` ([details](https://github.com/restx/restx/pull/72))
- added an unsecured resource to generated app for easier hello world test
- added settings loading in generated app
- use prod mode in generated start script

### tests

- added some build / contribution documentation to the project README
- trace all throwables thrown on main router route call
- improve error message on unauthorized proxy request
