# RESTX IDE Setup

Java has some of the best IDEs, free and open source. Although not necessary, we strongly recommend doing RESTX app development with an IDE.

RESTX being pure Java it's very straighforward to use in your IDE of choice. The only thing which require special attention is proper annotation processing setup.

You will find setup instructions for the 3 major Java IDE here:

- [Using RESTX with Eclipse](ide-eclipse.html)
- [Using RESTX with Netbeans](ide-netbeans.html)
