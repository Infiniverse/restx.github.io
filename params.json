{"name":"Restx","tagline":"RESTX, the lightweight Java REST framework","body":"### Welcome to RESTX.IO\r\n\r\nThis is the home page of the RESTX project, the lightweight Java REST framework:\r\n\r\n- **focused on REST, not a general web framework**\r\n\r\n   it means no templating mechanism, use it with your favorite JS framework!\r\n\r\n- **no reflection**\r\n\r\n   we prefer annotation processing, so that even with some magic you can always view the source.\r\n\r\n- **good performance**\r\n\r\n   everything is compiled, we always keep performance into account during the design, especially startup time.\r\n\r\n   Still the framework is not async oriented, this is a design choice: most data access API are synchronous anyway (JDBC, Mongo java driver, ...) and it's easier to program, especially for Java developers.\r\n\r\n   Async support is planned:\r\n     - through web socket with fallback support (probably with Atmosphere)\r\n     - through JavaRX support (not a priority)\r\n\r\n   If what you want is a truly async oriented framework, have a look at vert.x or Play2\r\n\r\n- **amazing integration with MongoDB...**\r\n\r\n   relying on Jackson and Jongo gives true symmetry between client and datastore payloads, plus some very cool features like data recording for easy integration testing \r\n\r\n- **... but not only**\r\n\r\n   restx is not specific to MongoDB, you can use it with any datastore with a Java API\r\n\r\n- **easy testing**\r\n\r\n   a human readable declarative end 2 end tests support with a recording feature easing non regression tests\r\n\r\n- **REST API documentation**\r\n\r\n   leveraging a customized version of swagger, as soon as you declare a end point it is documented\r\n\r\n- **... with innovation inside**\r\n\r\n   the declarative tests are also used as a source of documentation, giving always working examples!\r\n\r\n- **admin web console**\r\n\r\n   monitoring, DI container exploration, API documentation, recording console, ...\r\n\r\n- **enterprise friendly**\r\n\r\n   pure Java, can be deployed as a simple servlet, you can even use it alongside another framework, good maven support, relationnal DB support (soon)\r\n\r\n- **... but not only**\r\n\r\n   strong support for embedded launch, starts up in less than 0.5s (depends mostly on DB connection and class loading, by itself a restx server can start in less than 100ms)\r\n\r\n- **type safe DI**\r\n\r\n   features a small dependency injection engine, based on annotation processing and code generation\r\n\r\n- **strong integration with google guava and joda time**\r\n\r\n   because we can't live without them\r\n\r\n- **cloud friendly (soon)**\r\n\r\n   ready to deploy on many cloud offerings (Cloudbees, heroku, ...)\r\n\r\n- **easy to setup**\r\n\r\n   a command line helps to create new apps, run and deploy them on the cloud\r\n","google":"UA-40641346-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
